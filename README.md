# TIP

*Tiny Imperative Programming Language*

This project was implemented by University dof Brasília **(UnB)** students from Science Computer Department **(CIC)** and the develpoment was based in [Static Program Analysis’s book](https://users-cs.au.dk/amoeller/spa/spa.pdf), where it is used a Tiny Imperative Programming language **(TIP)**, which is based in a context free grammar, that has a very simple syntax and implements basic ’s constructions like expressions and statements but does not high level features like global variables, objects and others.

The goal of this projects is explore the concepts for Static Analysis and implement its basic algorithms.
